# monte-carlo

This repo contains code developed for the course on Monte Carlo I have taken during undergrad. *Programs may contain errors!* Since the course is finished, I do not intend to update it.
Programs are structured roughly as follows:

- [ex01](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex01), [ex03](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex03): introductory exercises based on **Ehrenfest urn model**.
- [ex05](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex05), [ex06](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex06): **Buffon's needle problem**.
- [ex07](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex07): **Numerical integration and sampling**.
- [ex08](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex08): **Markov chains and rejection sampling**.
- [ex11](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex11): **PRNG, numerical integration and importance sampling**.
- [ex12](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex12): **Random walks, lattices and self-avoiding walks**.
- [ex13](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ex13): **Percolation and the forest fire model**.
- [ex14, ex15, ex16, ex17](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/ising-model): **Ising model, Metropolis algorithm**.
- [functions](https://github.com/Vini-BM/monte-carlo/tree/main/functions): "module" with functions used in scripts.
